# --- Test Configuration ---
# Define the model to use for testing.
# We use the *original base model* from Hugging Face, not the fine-tuned one.
# This makes the tests stable and independent of the training job.
# We are testing the *logic* of the SentimentAnalyzer class (loading, preprocessing,
# inference), not the *quality* of the fine-tuning.
